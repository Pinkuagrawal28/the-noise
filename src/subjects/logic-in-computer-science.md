# Logic in Computer Science

Logic in computer science covers the overlap between the field of logic and that of computer science. The topic can be essentially divided into three main areas: theoretical foundations and analysis, use of logic in computer science, and applications of logic in computer science.

## Propositional Logic

Propositional logic, also known as sentential logic and statement logic, is the branch of logic that studies ways of joining and/or modifying entire propositions, statements or sentences to form more complicated propositions, statements or sentences, as well as the logical relationships and properties that are derived from these methods of combining or altering statements.

## Predicate Logic

Predicate logic, also known as first-order logic, is a collection of formal systems using quantified variables over non-logical objects and allowing the use of sentences that contain variables, so that rather than propositions such as "Socrates is a man", one can have expressions in the form "there exists x such that x is Socrates and x is a man" where "there exists" is a quantifier, while x is a variable.

## Temporal Logic

Temporal logic is the any system of rules and symbolism for representing, and reasoning about, propositions qualified in terms of time. It is a branch of logic that deals with time. In a temporal logic, a statement can have a truth value that varies with time. For example, the statement "I am hungry" may be true now, but it may not be true in an hour.
