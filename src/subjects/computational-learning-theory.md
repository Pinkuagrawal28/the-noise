# Computational Learning Theory

Computational learning theory (COLT) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that is devoted to the design and analysis of machine learning algorithms. It is a branch of theoretical computer science that focuses on the mathematical foundations of machine learning.

## Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) Learning

Probably approximately correct (PAC) learning is a framework in computational learning theory for the mathematical analysis of machine learning algorithms. The goal of PAC learning is to find a hypothesis that is approximately correct, with high probability. A hypothesis is approximately correct if its error is below a certain threshold. A hypothesis is probably correct if the probability of it being approximately correct is high.

## Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) Dimension

The Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension is a measure of the capacity of a hypothesis space. It is defined as the cardinality of the largest set of points that the algorithm can shatter. A set of points is shattered by a hypothesis space if for every possible labeling of the points, there is a hypothesis in the space that correctly labels them.

## Mistake Bounds

In computational learning theory, a mistake bound is a measure of the performance of an online learning algorithm. It is the maximum number of mistakes that the algorithm can make on any sequence of examples. A good online learning algorithm will have a small mistake bound.
