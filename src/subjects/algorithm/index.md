# Algorithm

An algorithm is a set of instructions for solving a problem or accomplishing a task. It is a fundamental concept in computer science and is used in a wide range of applications, from simple sorting and searching to complex machine learning models.

## Big O Notation

Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. It is used in computer science to classify algorithms according to their running time or space requirements.

### Common Time Complexities

| Name | Notation |
| :--- | :--- |
| Constant | O(1) |
| Logarithmic | O(log n) |
| Linear | O(n) |
| Linearithmic | O(n log n) |
| Quadratic | O(n^2) |
| Exponential | O(2^n) |
| Factorial | O(n!) |

## Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms are algorithms that put elements of a list in a certain order. The most-used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order.

### Bubble Sort

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

### Merge Sort

Merge sort is an efficient, comparison-based, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the implementation preserves the input order of equal elements in the sorted output.

### Quick Sort

Quick sort is an efficient sorting algorithm. Developed by British computer scientist Tony Hoare in 1959 and published in 1961, it is still a commonly used algorithm for sorting. When implemented well, it can be about two or three times faster than its main competitors, merge sort and heapsort.

## Searching Algorithms

Searching algorithms are algorithms that are used to find an element in a data structure.

### Linear Search

Linear search is a simple searching algorithm that sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.

### Binary Search

Binary search is a fast search algorithm with run-time complexity of O(log n). This search algorithm works on the principle of divide and conquer. For this algorithm to work correctly, the data collection should be in the sorted form.
