# Algorithmic Game Theory

Algorithmic game theory is an area in the intersection of game theory and computer science, with the objective of understanding and designing algorithms in strategic environments.

## Nash Equilibrium

In game theory, the Nash equilibrium is a solution concept of a non-cooperative game involving two or more players in which each player is assumed to know the equilibrium strategies of the other players, and no player has anything to gain by changing only their own strategy.

### Price of Anarchy

The price of anarchy is a concept in game theory that measures how the efficiency of a system degrades due to selfish behavior of its agents. It is the ratio between the worst possible Nash equilibrium and the social optimum.

## Mechanism Design

Mechanism design is a field in economics and game theory that takes an engineering approach to designing economic incentives or mechanisms, toward desired objectives, in strategic settings, where players act rationally.

### Revelation Principle

The revelation principle is a fundamental principle in mechanism design. It states that if a social choice function can be implemented by an arbitrary mechanism, then it can be implemented by a direct, truthful mechanism.

## Auctions

An auction is a process of buying and selling goods or services by offering them up for bid, taking bids, and then selling the item to the highest bidder.

### Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) Auction

The Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction is a type of sealed-bid auction. It is a generalization of a Vickrey auction for multiple items. VCG auctions are truthful, meaning that bidders are incentivized to bid their true valuations.
