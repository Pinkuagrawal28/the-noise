# Formal Methods

In computer science, specifically software engineering and hardware engineering, formal methods are a particular kind of mathematically based techniques for the specification, development and verification of software and hardware systems. The use of formal methods for software and hardware design is motivated by the expectation that, as in other engineering disciplines, performing appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute to the reliability and robustness of a design.

## Model Checking

Model checking is a method for checking whether a finite-state model of a system meets a given specification (also known as temporal logic). This is typically done by an exhaustive search of all possible states of the system. The specification is usually given as a formula in a temporal logic, such as linear temporal logic (LTL) or computation tree logic (CTL).

## Theorem Proving

Theorem proving is the process of using a computer program to prove mathematical theorems. Automated theorem provers are programs that can prove theorems automatically. Interactive theorem provers, also known as proof assistants, require a human user to guide the proof.

## Abstract Interpretation

Abstract interpretation is a theory of sound approximation of the semantics of computer programs, based on monotonic functions over ordered sets, especially lattices. It can be viewed as a partial execution of a computer program which gains information about its semantics (e.g., control-flow, data-flow) without performing all the calculations.
