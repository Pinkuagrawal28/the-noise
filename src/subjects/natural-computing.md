# Natural Computing

Natural computing is a terminology introduced to encompass three classes of methods: 1) that which takes inspiration from nature for the development of novel problem-solving techniques; 2) that which is based on the use of computers to synthesize natural phenomena; and 3) that which employs natural materials (e.g., molecules) to compute. The main fields of research that compose these three branches are artificial neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, swarm intelligence, artificial immune systems, fractal geometry, artificial life, DNA computing, and quantum computing.

## Evolutionary Computation

Evolutionary computation is a subfield of artificial intelligence (more particularly computational intelligence) that involves combinatorial optimization problems. Evolutionary computation uses iterative progress, such as growth or development in a population. This population is then selected in a guided random search using parallel processing to achieve the desired end.

## Swarm Intelligence

Swarm intelligence is the collective behavior of decentralized, self-organized systems, natural or artificial. The concept is employed in work on artificial intelligence. The expression was introduced by Gerardo Beni and Jing Wang in 1989, in the context of cellular robotic systems.

## Artificial Immune Systems

Artificial immune systems are a class of computationally intelligent, rule-based machine learning systems inspired by the principles and processes of the vertebrate immune system. The algorithms are typically modeled after the immune system's characteristics of learning and memory, and used in problem-solving.
