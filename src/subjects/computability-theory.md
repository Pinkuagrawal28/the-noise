# Computability Theory

Computability theory, also known as recursion theory, is a branch of mathematical logic, of computer science, and of the theory of computation that originated in the 1930s with the study of computable functions and Turing degrees. The field has since expanded to include the study of generalized computability and definability. In these areas, recursion theory overlaps with proof theory and effective descriptive set theory.

## Halting Problem

The halting problem is the problem of determining, from a description of an arbitrary computer program and an input, whether the program will finish running or continue to run forever. Alan Turing proved in 1936 that a general algorithm to solve the halting problem for all possible program-input pairs cannot exist.

## Church-Turing Thesis

The Church-Turing thesis (formerly commonly known simply as Church's thesis) is a thesis about the nature of computable functions. It states that a function on the natural numbers is computable by a human being following an algorithm, ignoring resource limitations, if and only if it is computable by a Turing machine.

## Recursive Functions

In mathematical logic and computer science, a recursive function, also called a general recursive function, is a function from the natural numbers to the natural numbers that is "computable" in some intuitive sense. In fact, in computability theory it is shown that the recursive functions are precisely the functions that can be computed by Turing machines.
