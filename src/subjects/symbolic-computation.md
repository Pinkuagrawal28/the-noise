# Symbolic Computation

Symbolic computation, also known as computer algebra or algebraic computation, is a scientific area that refers to the study and development of algorithms and software for manipulating mathematical expressions and other mathematical objects. Although, properly speaking, symbolic computation should be a subfield of scientific computing, they are generally considered as distinct fields because scientific computing is usually based on numerical computation with approximate floating point numbers, while symbolic computation emphasizes exact computation with expressions containing variables that have no given value and are manipulated as symbols.

## Computer Algebra Systems

A computer algebra system (CAS) is a software program that facilitates symbolic mathematics. The core functionality of a CAS is manipulation of mathematical expressions in symbolic form.

## Automated Theorem Proving

Automated theorem proving (also known as ATP or automated deduction) is a subfield of automated reasoning and mathematical logic dealing with proving mathematical theorems by computer programs. Automated reasoning over mathematical proof was a major impetus for the development of computer science.

## Symbolic Integration

Symbolic integration is the problem of finding a formula for the antiderivative, or indefinite integral, of a given function f(x). This is a classic problem in symbolic computation, and has been the subject of much research. The Risch algorithm is a general algorithm for symbolic integration, but it is very complex and has not been fully implemented in any computer algebra system.
