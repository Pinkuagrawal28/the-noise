# Preface

Welcome to "The Noise â€“ Information Theory Notes." This collection aims to provide a comprehensive yet accessible introduction to the fascinating field of Information Theory.

## What is Information Theory?

Information Theory, founded by Claude Shannon in his seminal 1948 paper "A Mathematical Theory of Communication," is a mathematical framework for quantifying, storing, and communicating information. It provides fundamental limits on how much data can be compressed and how reliably it can be transmitted over a noisy channel.

### Historical Context

The field was primarily established by Claude Shannon in 1948, laying the groundwork for modern digital communication. His work provided a rigorous mathematical definition of information and introduced key concepts like entropy and channel capacity.

### Applications

Information Theory has profound applications across various domains:

-   **Communication:** It underpins the design of efficient and reliable communication systems, from mobile phones to satellite communication.
-   **Data Science:** Concepts like entropy and mutual information are crucial for feature selection, data compression, and understanding data dependencies.
-   **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning:** Used in areas like decision trees (information gain), neural network compression, and understanding the information flow in learning models.
-   **Physics:** Connections to thermodynamics (entropy as disorder), statistical mechanics, and quantum information theory.
-   **Biology:** Analyzing information flow in genetic codes, neural networks, and evolutionary processes.
