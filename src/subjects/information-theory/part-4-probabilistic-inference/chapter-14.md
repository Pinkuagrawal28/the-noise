# Chapter 14 - Laplace’s Method & Model Comparison

This chapter explores Laplace's Method as an approximation technique in inference and discusses how information theory principles, particularly Occam's razor, guide model comparison.

## Approximation in Inference (Laplace’s Method)

Laplace's Method is a technique for approximating integrals, particularly those that arise in Bayesian inference for calculating marginal likelihoods or posterior distributions.

-   **Core Idea:** It approximates a probability distribution (often a posterior) with a Gaussian distribution centered at the mode of the distribution. This is based on the idea that for large amounts of data, the posterior often becomes sharply peaked and can be well-approximated by a Gaussian.
-   **Procedure:** Involves finding the mode of the function (e.g., the maximum a posteriori estimate) and then approximating the function around that mode using a Taylor expansion up to the second order.
-   **Advantages:** Provides a relatively simple and often effective analytical approximation, especially for models where exact inference is difficult.
-   **Limitations:** Works best when the posterior is unimodal and reasonably symmetric.

## Occam’s Razor in Model Selection

Occam's razor is a principle that states, among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected. In information theory and Bayesian inference, this principle finds a natural mathematical formulation.

-   **Model Complexity vs. Fit:** Simpler models are preferred over more complex ones if they explain the data equally well. Complex models have more "ways" to fit the data, but also more ways to be wrong.
-   **Information-Theoretic Justification:**
    -   **Minimum Description Length (MDL):** A principle that suggests the best model is the one that minimizes the sum of the length of the model description and the length of the data description given the model. This inherently penalizes model complexity.
    -   **Bayesian Model Evidence:** In Bayesian inference, simpler models often have higher marginal likelihoods (evidence) because they concentrate their predictive power on a smaller set of outcomes, making them more "surprising" if they fit the data well. Complex models spread their probability mass more thinly.
-   **Application:** Occam's razor, often quantified through information criteria (like AIC or BIC) or Bayesian evidence, is a crucial tool for comparing and selecting among different statistical or machine learning models.
