# Chapter 12 - Probability Distributions Useful in Information Theory

This chapter reviews several key probability distributions that are frequently encountered and particularly useful in the study and application of information theory. Understanding their properties, especially their entropy, is crucial.

## Gaussian, Bernoulli, Exponential Families

-   **Gaussian (Normal) Distribution:**
    -   Characterized by its mean and variance.
    -   Crucial in continuous-variable information theory, especially for the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel.
    -   Among all distributions with a given variance, the Gaussian distribution has the maximum entropy, making it a "least informative" or "most random" distribution under that constraint.
-   **Bernoulli Distribution:**
    -   Models a single binary outcome (success/failure) with a probability `p` for success.
    -   Fundamental for binary channels (e.g., Binary Symmetric Channel) and for understanding the entropy of binary sources.
-   **Exponential Family:**
    -   A broad class of probability distributions that includes many common distributions like Bernoulli, Poisson, Gaussian, Gamma, etc.
    -   They share certain mathematical properties that make them amenable to analysis in statistical inference and machine learning, often appearing in maximum entropy models.

## Entropy Properties

For each of these distributions, understanding their entropy is key:

-   **Differential Entropy (for continuous distributions like Gaussian):** An extension of discrete entropy to continuous random variables. It can be negative and is sensitive to the choice of units.
-   **Maximizing Entropy:** The principle of maximum entropy states that, subject to certain constraints (e.g., known mean or variance), the probability distribution that best represents the current state of knowledge is the one with the largest entropy. This is often used to choose a default or "least biased" distribution.
-   **Relationship to Information Content:** The entropy of these distributions directly quantifies the average uncertainty or information content associated with samples drawn from them.
