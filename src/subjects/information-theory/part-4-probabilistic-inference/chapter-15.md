# Chapter 15 - Bayesian Inference & Decision Theory

This chapter integrates information theory with Bayesian inference and decision theory, highlighting how a Bayesian perspective naturally incorporates information and how decisions can be optimized based on expected information gain.

## Bayesian Viewpoint on Information

Bayesian inference provides a powerful framework for updating beliefs in the face of new evidence, and information theory plays a crucial role in quantifying this process.

-   **Prior and Posterior Distributions:** Bayesian inference starts with a prior belief (prior distribution) about a hypothesis or parameter. Upon observing data, this prior is updated to a posterior distribution using Bayes' theorem.
-   **Information Gain:** The process of moving from a prior to a posterior distribution can be seen as gaining information. The KL divergence between the prior and the posterior quantifies the information gained about the parameters from the data.
-   **Entropy Reduction:** Observing data reduces uncertainty. The reduction in entropy from the prior to the posterior distribution is a direct measure of the information provided by the data.

## Decision Theory and Expected Information Gain

Decision theory provides a framework for making optimal decisions under uncertainty. When combined with information theory, it allows for decisions that maximize the expected utility, often by considering the value of acquiring more information.

-   **Utility Functions:** Quantify the desirability of different outcomes.
-   **Expected Utility:** The average utility of a decision, weighted by the probabilities of different outcomes.
-   **Value of Information:** Before making a decision, one might consider whether to gather more information. The "expected value of perfect information" or "expected information gain" quantifies how much a decision-maker would be willing to pay for additional information. This is often calculated using concepts like mutual information.
-   **Optimal Decisions:** In a Bayesian decision-theoretic framework, the optimal decision is the one that maximizes expected utility, taking into account all available information and the potential for acquiring more.
