# Parallel Algorithms

A parallel algorithm is an algorithm which can be executed a piece at a time on many different processing devices, and then combined together again at the end to get the correct result. Parallel algorithms are used to improve the performance of computation-intensive tasks.

## Models of Parallel Computation

### PRAM Model

The Parallel Random Access Machine (PRAM) model is a model of a shared-memory parallel computer. In the PRAM model, there are a number of processors that can all access a shared memory. The processors can all read from and write to the shared memory in parallel.

### Network Model

The network model is a model of a distributed-memory parallel computer. In the network model, there are a number of processors that are connected by a network. The processors can communicate with each other by sending messages over the network.

## Parallel Sorting Algorithms

Parallel sorting algorithms are algorithms that are designed to be run on a parallel computer. There are a number of different parallel sorting algorithms, including bitonic sort, parallel merge sort, and parallel quicksort.

## Parallel Graph Algorithms

Parallel graph algorithms are algorithms that are designed to be run on a parallel computer. There are a number of different parallel graph algorithms, including parallel breadth-first search, parallel depth-first search, and parallel algorithms for finding minimum spanning trees.
